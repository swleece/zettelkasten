[[Obsidian]] and [[Personal Knowledge Management]] concept of nodes in the knowledge graph. 

In practice, when implementing Obsidian as a PKM, the suggestion is to use a higher level Note (using brackets) instead of a tag (\#). 
This creates a node in the knowledge graph whereas a tag does not and can only be used to filter (note that filename conventions are also used in my system for filtering).
