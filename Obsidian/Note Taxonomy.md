[[Obsidian]]
Inspired by [[= BryanJenks Zettelkasten workflow]].

Use first character of a Note's filename to denote the input type. 
Makes it easy to subsearch, filter, and create new notes that are prefilled with desired template (using JS). 
- use in conjunction with having a date in every filename for easy date functionality
- note that it is possible to filter in graph view by path, I could try having folders for different input types instead of first character of file
- 

| First char of filename | Input type            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| @                      | People                |
| {                      | Books                 |
| $                      | Coding Knowledge      |
| !                      | Exercise Log          |
| =                      | Internet Content      |
| &                      | Concepts and Thoughts |
| +                      | Daily                 |



### Personal Zettelkasten Idea Workshop
- broadly using tech as case study to determine where notes should live
- attempt to use the tools at hand via obsidian and file system

### Notes Taxonomy
- Notes on a source material 
	- (books, articles, online content (mb by platform?), )
	- e.g. computer science articles, concepts from computer science articles 
- Notes on personal ideas
	- personal thoughts / opinions on tech
	- impact of tech on people or my life
	- ideas for applications or ways to apply tech
- Notes on technical / productivity tools
	- programming languages, coding tools
	- 
- output types (writing, )

#### Desired Outcome
- traversable knowledge graph with reasonable nodes up and down levels of abstraction
- searchable and filterable bank of notes

- Create links to MOC's that may not exist
	- once there are enough links to the MOC, create a full fledged note for it

- ability to traverse knowledge graph
	- 
-  Date related
	- always include date as date tag
	- daily/monthly/yearly review notes
		- link each daily to prev/next and to it's month, link each month to it's year
- ability to filter while using obsidian Quick Switcher
	- prepend file names with input type symbol, date
	- use folders for input type(?)
	- MOC's for larger abstract notes
- ability to track note maturity
	- tags work best for this (should it be it's own tag, or a generic tag, use emojis?)
	- 



#### Tools at Hand
- Search
	- Obsidian quick switcher
		- searches file name
	- grep repo
- Filtering
	- Tags
		- date, topic(?), note maturity, 
- Knowledge Graph
	- Obsidian's graph view
	- 

#### Potential Methods
- include input type and date at beginning of file name
	- enables filtering while using the quick switcher



## Current Method
1. Tags for date, time, note_maturity, input type
	- note_maturity tag uses emojis ( üå± , üåø , üå≤ )
	- date tag, time tag
	- note content type (summary of content (e.g. podcast, book, etc.), idea, question)
2. Dataview queries
	- for timelines
	- for finding and updating immature notes
3. Use Notes for MOC's
	- avoid using a tag for anything that could potentially one day be a note of it's own
	- 
4. Idea compass at bottom of notes
	- prompts me to think of connections with other cards I might not otherwise think to tag
