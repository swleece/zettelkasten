### Learning

Today I learned from a programming pairing session with [[Vikas Varma]].
We explored modeling Langsmith runs. 
Essentially, we pulled data from Langsmith traced runs and coerced it into a format that our existing evals would accept.
Key concepts included serialization and deserialization of pydantic models, as well as reinstantiating data as core langchain classes.
