### Exercise

Climbed at El Cap Base western slack. Practiced aid on Short but Thin and then flashed Sacherer Cracker. Almost threw up after the offwidth section on that... ðŸ¤¢ 
Still figuring out the exercise-induced nausea. So far it seems to be worst after doing full-body, offwidthy moves at elevation when I am also at elevation for the first time in a while.
Currently listening to [[Huberman on How to Breathe Correctly]] and am thinking breath work might help alleviate this a bit.
