### Journal

### Learning
Yesterday and today I've been working on an ML project on [[Kaggle]]. It's a pretty cool environment for practicing. It has also been hugely useful to use [[ChatGPT]]  to get small code snippets for data cleaning, simple scripts, and pointed questions about how to implement models.
There are also some good resources and examples on the site. Probably a good place to mine for practical tips.

### Exercise
Long session at the gym today. Bookended bouldering with ~20min stairs, shooting for 150 bpm.
Felt good bouldering and did so for a couple hours. Sending in the v6/v7 range at the top.
