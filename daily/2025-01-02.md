# Journal

First day back at work in 2025. The talk is all about agents. I am continuing work building my own toy projects with langgraph, but it's tricky with all their abstractions...

## Learning

- I watched a some more of a lecture series (an intro to computing with python) from the MIT Open Courseware catalog. 

## Professional 
## Social

- Time with Bug. Planning to hang out with Emma and Andy tomorrow at the gym and on Saturday getting tacos.

## Exercise

- 30 min spin + hangboarding. Thinking about setting a goal around getting my heart rate up to 170 every x days per week.

## Entertainment

- I watched an episode of Squid Game 2 with Bug.

## Tasks

- [x] #task Create wedding website âœ… 2025-05-02
