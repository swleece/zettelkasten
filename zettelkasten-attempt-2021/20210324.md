Today I continued work on Cypress testing at work. It's going fairly well I'd say, some progress made. 
Currently we're staying at Bug's parents place. We'll soon be house-sitting here for a couple months.
I had a realization while riding the other day, the inspiration for beginning to build the zettelkasten, that my mind and body are no longer propelled by my youth essentially. 
30 feels a bit like a turning point, though I know it isn't. For a variety of reasons, though, I'm reexamining my habits and my way of life. 
Let's not forget we just had Covid. That has forced me to confront the fragility of my health.
At work, I've been feeling a bit stressed, a bit overwhelmed. In large part because I am trying to take on new stuff to learn things. This has been good, but does come with stress as the greatest form of pressure on me is when I'm actually motivated to improve myself.
I suppose this zettelkasten may be good if it pushes me to slow down and reflect more. That's something I should do more.
