## Title
Decision Tree model

## Description
Tree consists of root node, decision nodes, and leaf nodes.

Each example can be traced from root to leaf based on its features and the 
and which direction the nodes point given those features.

The algorithm's purity is given by how many examples are correctly predicted 
given the tree's structure.

Tree depth refers the number of hops from root to leaf.
(lower depth reduces risk of overfitting)
