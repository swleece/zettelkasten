## Title
Bias and Variance

## Description
High bias (underfit)
- likely high Jtrain, cost associated with the training set
- likely high Jcv, cost associated with the cross validation set

High variance (overfit)
- low Jtrain
- high Jcv

Degree of Polynomial:

. - Jtrain
x - Jcv

## Additional Notes
it is also possible to have high bias and high variance
(high Jtrain and high Jcv)
Usually if there are different parts of the input that would do well with
different models entirely.
