## Title
Large neural networks are low bias machines

## Description
Method:
Does your Neural network perform well on training set? 
No -> use a bigger network (more hidden layers, or more units per layer)
repeat
Yes 

Does it do well on the cross validation set?
No -> use more data
repeat start of loop

Yes -> Done!

A large network will usually do as well or better than a smaller one
so long as regularization is chosen appropriately.


## Additional Notes
Caveats:
Big networks require computational power
More data is not always available
