## Title
Learning Curves

## Description
Observes the increasing Jtrain (training set cost) with increasing 
training set size.

Observes the decreasing Jcv (cross validation set cost) with increasing 
training set size.

## Additional Notes
One downside is the computational cost of training models with increasing
amounts of data in order to generate curve.
