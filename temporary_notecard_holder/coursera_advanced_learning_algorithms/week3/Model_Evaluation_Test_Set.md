## Title
Model Evaluation: Test set

## Description
Split your data set into a training set and a test set (80:20 for example).

If the model performs poorly on the test set after training with only the
training set, then the model does not generalize well.

Poor performance can be measured by the using the Cost function (in the case
of linear regression models), or counting the number of failures against the 
training set vs the number of failures against the test set.
