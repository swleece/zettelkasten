## Title
Model Selection: Using degree of polynomial

## Description
Method:
Split data into training, cross validation set, and test set (i.e. 60:20:20).
Train multiple models on the training set with a range of degree of polynomial.
Or with different model architecture (number of hidden layers, nodes per).

Calculate the cost associated with each model using the cross validation set
and select the one with lowest cost.

To determine generalizability, now calculate the cost (or the fraction of
successes for classification problems) against the test set.
