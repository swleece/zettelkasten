## La Sportiva

40 (euro) - 7.5 (USM)
40.5 - 8
41 - 8.5

2022 Skwama - 40 (7.5 US Men's)
- good size, broke in pretty quickly
- toes able to lie flat barely, could probably toe jam fairly well
- Update: had a bad experience with these on a hot day, likely need to size up 1/2 size (40.5) for multi-pitch

2021 (and earlier) TC Pros - 41
- good
2022 TC
Pros - 41
- slightly large, the point of the big toe has some air space

2020(?) Otakis - 40.5 
- slightly small in toe box
- took a very long time to break in
- even after breaking in, second toe does not lie flat
	- therefore toe jamming not really possible comfortably
 - could try sizing up to 41

2023 La Sportiva Finale - 40.5
- comfortable immediately pretty much
- toes pretty much lie flat
- the rubber feels really not sticky
