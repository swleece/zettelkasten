## La Sportiva

2022 Skwama - 40 
- good size
- broke in pretty quickly
- toes able to lie flat, could probably toe jam fairly well

2021 (and earlier) TC Pros - 41
- good
2022 TC Pros - 41
- slightly large, the point of the big toe has some air space

2020(?) Otakis - 40.5 
- slightly small in toe box
- took a very long time to break in
- even after breaking in, second toe does not lie flat
	- therefore toe jamming not really possible comfortably
 - could try sizing up to 41
