# Inventions

## Aid stick clip attachment
- able to place cams, nuts, and draws
- useful for aid climbing 
	- reaching a solid placement that is far away
	- skipping placements to move faster
- attach to light pole, potentially a weak, breakable pole for safety

# Innovations

### Lead Rope Solo

- quick link on belay loop as backup to main with friction based cache loop management (something similar to the backfeed protector for quickdraws)
	- would still want to use knots in the line probably
	- potential risk of rope running over belay loop ‚ò†Ô∏è
		- could mitigate by using a different type of connector (swivel? three quick links? second belay loop? second belay loop and double ropes?)
