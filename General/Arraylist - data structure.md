# Arraylist - Javascript

is sort of an array, allocates memory for an array, but does not have values for unless they are later added, keeps track of "length" of the list by keeping a counter

If you push over the size limit, you can mem copy over all the values to a new, larger array
- works because you are only operating at one end 

best to give a realistic initial capacity to limit the number of growing operations 

Can be inefficient for enqueue / deque operations 
- because you need to shift each element on each operation
	- e.g. you're operating at both ends
