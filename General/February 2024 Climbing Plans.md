# Red Rock Feb 16-19

## Plan

Friday:
- drive out to Vegas ~midday / afternoon, pick up Bryan and go to TJ's to stock up for the weekend
- drive out to lovell to camp (maybe stealth camp closer to eagle wall?)

Saturday:
- early start for Eagle Wall

would be too hard to approach from the top

get gpx file to follow to get to the base
- do down scramble we did previously
- at steep boulder field, continue down instead of breaking right
- as it flattens out, traverse across the base of the formation, might feel a bit exposed
- scramble / downclimb to get into the gully heading to climber's left side of the wall
- identify place where blocks have fallen out, light yellow rock scar, aim for the right facing corner

walk off is straightforward
- go up 5.5 chimney to finish out unroped
- follow ridgeline to summit
- follow cairns back to tree that marks the descent into the canyon

Summit is the highpoint

light rack for silent disco and the 510
- can rap into silent disco
- can walk off

send an email asking for a doc for the new 10a, Over Easy
- walk off
- pitches are long with no rap stations
- every belay is bolted
- new 5.10 route is super cool (near top not as great)
	- p2 - great face
