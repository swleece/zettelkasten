# Binary Search

Useful if you have an ordered array.

- check midpoint of array against target value 
- pick the correct direction to move in based on g.t. l.t.
- check the midpoint of that half of the array
- repeat...

### Big O 

log(N)

Heuristic: if repeatedly reducing array size, then likely O(log(N)) or O(N log(N))


## Binary Search Tree

at any single node, left child (and all it's children) is l.t.e to, right child (and all it's children) is g.t.
- very similar to quick sort
