# Stack

Opposite of a [[Queues - data structure]]

(A) <- (B) <- (C) <- (D)
								head

stack trace = stack of functions that have been called

FILO

Singly linked list

You only add or remove from position the head is pointing.

Looking at things like a stack helps when thinking about recursion.

Has a peek operation like Queues.

Push (shift in js) : add an item

Pop (unshift in js) : remove an item

Counter used to keep track of length.
