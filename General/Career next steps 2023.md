# Career Thoughts and Plans

I'm inspired to make a change in what I've been doing. 
I've learned a lot in my [[Quality Assurance]] work at [[AppFolio]] but I feel I need to pick a new direction for continued growth. 
The advancements in [[Machine Learning]] have also been very exciting and I feel there is a lot of room for value that AppFolio is not moving to capture.
I don't feel like I can effect much change regarding an uptake of [[Large Language Models]]-powered value as a QA engineer.

## Possible Next Steps

### Rotation as a Dev

1. Full stack dev
	- need to talk to [[Ramon Rovirosa]]
	- Next steps might be to take some courses to get prepped
	- 
1. SDET
	- plan to talk to [[Donnie Ahmad]]
	- next steps might be to take some courses to get prepped
	- this doesn't really excite me unfortunately
1. Junior ML engineer
	- [[Michael Leece]] said this might be possible as there are other junior ML engineers (usually interns or recent grads)
	- suggested proposing a project as a way to do this
	- alternatively, could work on improving an existing project

### Something else

- [[Prompt engineering]]? 
	- what might this look like? 
	- how confident am i that this will exist in the future?
- Product Manager? 
	- would be worth talking to Ryan about this possibility
	- would want to have a technical slant
- Market Validation?
