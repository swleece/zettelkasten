# Brewing with a Moka Pot Bialetti

inspired by The Ultimate [[Moka Pot]] Technique - James Hoffman youtube

1. start with freshly boiled water poured into the base of the pot
2. use a full basket of [[coffee]]
	- most brewers work on ~ 10:1 ratio water to coffee (for my current size ~30 g coffee, ~300 mL water)
3. puck prep
	- needle distribute if you can
	- tap to settle
	- put an aeropress filter and wet it stuck under the metal filter
4. avoid the hot sputtering phase at the end
	- try to slow heating and pull off the heat just before this sputtering would occur
5. brewing
	- heat until liquid begins to flow, then try to maintain that pressure and not increase
		- this may mean you'll need to surf the temp on your heating surface
	- run heat as low as possible once liquid starts to flow (unless flow slows down or stops)
	- watch for steady medium flow of liquid
6. pour immediately (potentially cool under water if overheated)

Grind:
- the lighter the roast, the finer the grind
- finer than a V60, filter coffee, less fine than espresso, roughly a fine [[aeropress]]

- less filled boiler -> brew earlier -> lower brew temp : use for darker roast
- for a lighter roast -> more water -> full boiler

- use a towel to screw down

- expect ~ 200 g out with a fairly high extraction for lighter roasts

- 150 to 120 for darker roasts
