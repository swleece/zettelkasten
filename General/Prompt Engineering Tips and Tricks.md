# Tips for Prompt Engineering 

Chain of Thought prompts:
- To reduce hallucination, ask the model to prepend its answer with "My best guess is"  
- "Let's think step by step" "Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer."
- 

GPT can only do so much in one prompt, don't try to have it make multiple logical leaps within on response

- DeepLearning.ai [course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) on prompt engineering
	- clear and specific instructions
	- give the model time to think
	- iterative prompt dev
	- Summarizing, Inferring, Transforming
	- Expanding
	- building a chatbot
