ChatGPT is often construed as a better google. What are some ways that ChatGPT could be used?

### Potential Applications of GhatGPT

Automotive reference:
- understanding search results in the automotive domain can be difficult because it requires a large amount of context
- using ChatGPT to resolve automotive questions might be more effective
- you may get good results by first gathering specific information from the user like model, make, year, mileage, then combining that with the user's actual query in a way that intelligently asks ChatGPT the question
- provide this as a service alongside ads potentially

To generalize the automotive idea, it might be the case that ChatGPT can be good for sourcing answers in domains where the individual doesn't have a lot of contextual knowledge.
