# Everything is a Number

Eventually, everything must be encoded as a series of zeros and ones.
This is simple to imagine for positive integers, whose base 10 representation is simply converted to base 2 and then stored in a series of bits.
For other data types, conventions have been created to encode them as bits.


## Python Data Types
### Strings 

A sequence of characters.
In python, strings are a particular type of object.

The dot operator can be called on objects to access methods and data.

Brackets `[]` can also be used to access values at valid indexes.

### Lists and Tuples

Python has two ways to construct sequences of data.
Both allow you to write down multiple data items in one object that contains those elements.

Tuples typically used to group together data that form a logical whole
Tuples can hold different types of data.

### Images

Most common way to encode color is via RGB encoding (specifying how much red, green, and blue they contain)
`p = (255, 127, 0)`
A list of lists with one element for each pixel can be used to represent an image.

### Sound and Video

Sound can be encoded by recording the "height" of the waveform at periodic intervals
- higher sampling rate -> better quality
- stereo sound has 2 sequences for left and right channel

Video can simply be a sequence of images in conjunction with a sequence of sounds.
- all common formats apply compression for storage, otherwise storage requirements would be massive
