G-force applied in the left / right direction and due to acceleration / deceleration

A skilled rider will have maximise force applied in all directions at all times to the limit of the friction that tires can provide (about 1.5 G left / right, 1.2 G accel, 2 G decel).

The shape of a graph will appear as a larger circle for a skilled rider, a smaller dot for an unskilled rider, and a rounded plus sign for those between, only lacking in ability to accelerate or decelerate while shifting force to cornering.
