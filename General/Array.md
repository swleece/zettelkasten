# Array (data structure)

Contiguous memory space that contains a certain number of bytes

01011 ...
`[           ]`
0                     N

`a=int[3]`
`a[0]`

Computers access  index values based on known slot lengths

## Array Buffer

A continuous bit of memory in javascript
you can walk an 8bit array in 16bit steps (jumping one)

## Insertion

You can't simply grow an array, it has a set allocation of memory.
Instead you overwrite values.
Similarly, you don't delete elements from the array, instead you overwrite to zero / null.

## Retrieval

O(1) - Constant time
depends on a, width, offset, not n

## Initialization



## Usability of an array

- index accessing
- space is set 
- No true insert 
- timewise, lots of operations are O(1)

- Memory has already been set
