# Andrew Ng: Opportunities in AI - 2023

- Supervised learning still the largest driver of ML adoption, commercialization
- Generative AI will see explosive growth but still much smaller overall
- "Massive value remains to be created using supervised learning (labeling things)"
- Smaller teams, empowered by a greater toolset, can start to develop for the many remaining smaller problems that now become financially viable
	- food inspection, ship steering optimization, agricultural optimizations
- starting new companies is how to capture these smaller, application-specific problems
