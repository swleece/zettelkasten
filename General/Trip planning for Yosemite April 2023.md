## April 28th - 30th

28: South Face of Washington Column
29: maybe climb in morning, Ximeng going to a wedding, Bug may drive out to hang in afternoon
30 

South Face of Washington Column speed options:
- Kor roof: only clip the rope to the last bolt

## Post-climb Notes on Washington Column

We climbed 7 pitches then decided to rap due to time.
I led 1,2,4,6. Aided ~half of p2 on 5.11 thin. Aided 4, 6.

### Ways we could've sped things up:

- Gear: bring extra 0.5 for Kor roof pitch?

1. Free climb p2
	- I mostly aided the 5.11 standard route but the 5.10 variation looks fun and doable
2. Free climb p3 then short-fix Kor roof pitch
	- not likely to be possible unless no one is ahead of you
	- follower should TR solo p3, not jug
3. Alternatively, shortfix p5 (pendulum pitch)
	- will probably need to tag up gear
4. Be sure to backclean on p7, it will take all your small gear
