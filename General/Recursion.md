# Recursion

Something that calls itself over and over again

Simplest form is a function that calls itself until a "base case" is reached.
The base case is the point at which the problem is solved.

The Base Case is extremely important. 

## Example

```
foo(n):
  1. base case if n = 1:
	  return 1
  2. recurse:
	  return n + foo(n-1)
```

2. recurse step can be broken down into
	1. pre: n+
	2. recurse: call function
	3. can do a post recurse operation
