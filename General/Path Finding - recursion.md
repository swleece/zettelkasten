# Maze Solver 

Given list of strings 

\[
"# # # # # # # E",
"#                     #",
"# S # # # # # #"
\]

At any one square, we can try to move in any one direction.

Base Case:
1. its a wall - invalid state and can't go there
2. off the map - invalid state and can't go there
3. its the end - finished the maze 
4. if we have seen the square before

Often want to create a separate function for your recursion that is called by your solver function.
