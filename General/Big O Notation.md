# Big O Notation

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input. It is not meant to be an exact measurement. It is meant to generalize the scalability of your algorithm.

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends toward a particular value or infinity. Big O is a member of a family of notation invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann-Landau notation, or asymptotic notation. The letter O was chosen by Bachmann to stand for Ornung, meaning the order of approximation.

As your input grows, how fast dos your computation or memory grow?

##  Rules

- ignore constants
- ignore insignificant terms
	- only include the highest polynomial
	- (as n scales, n^2 can be ignored compared to n^3)

## Heuristics 

- look for loops, look for loops within loops
-
