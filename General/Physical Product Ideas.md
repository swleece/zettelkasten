buckle-strap-clamp system for changing fitted sheets on a mattress

purpose-built box for storing/transporting a climbing rack 
- possibly with way to easily transfer to a backpack
- convenience from closet-cliff and back 
- comes from my difficulty staying organized while moving around

Dog chew toy / tooth brusher
- possibly a rope with a foam core and mesh kernmantle‚ùì

[[Climbing Inventions and Innovations]]
- Belay/Rappel/progress capture device that will cam shut on one side if the rope end passes through the other side
- removable rod that can be inserted into rope ends and will jam when passing through a rappel device
	- attach brightly colored ribbon with some reflective thread to end sticking out for visibility
	- there should be a joint in the middle between two rod sections. When twisted, teeth can extend to grab the sheath of the rope and hold the device in place
		- alternatively, there could be a button at the end of the rod to extend / retract teeth

Snow density measurement for avalanche risk prediction:
- laser based
	- can you determine density by shining a laser through snow?
- thermal gravimetric
	- can you measure melting rate of snow to determine density?
- simple gravimetric
	- can you measure the weight of snow at fine enough resolution
