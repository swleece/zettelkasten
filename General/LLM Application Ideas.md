# LLM AppIication Ideas

## Automotive QA:

- understanding search results in the automotive domain can be difficult because it requires a large amount of context
- using ChatGPT to resolve automotive questions might be more effective
- you may get good results by first gathering specific information from the user like model, make, year, mileage, then combining that with the user's actual query in a way that intelligently asks ChatGPT the question
- provide this as a service alongside ads potentially

To generalize the automotive idea, it might be the case that ChatGPT can be good for sourcing answers in domains where the individual doesn't have a lot of contextual knowledge. 

## LLM-powered fact checking app for articles

Start with just analysis of single claims using web search and LLM reasoning.
Layer on top of that analysis of whole article at once.
