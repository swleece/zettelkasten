# Linked List

(A) -> (B) -> (C) -> (D)

Each node consists of a valued and a reference to the next node.

Can be singly linked, doubly linked.

Unconnected nodes can be garbage collected. 

Enables insertion/deletion in constant time (O(1), independent of the list's n).

Traversal to middle points can be slow but operations at the head or tail can be very fast.

## Usability of Linked List

- linear search is your only option
- 


## Implementation

be sure to update connections between nodes in an order that will make will 
- add connections, then remove connections
-
