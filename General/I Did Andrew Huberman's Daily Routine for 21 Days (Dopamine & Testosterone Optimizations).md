# I Did Andrew Huberman's Daily Routine for 21 Days (Dopamine & Testosterone Optimizations)

## Phase 1

#### Morning Routine
- Sunlight in your eyes early in the day
	- want to peak cortisol in the morning
- drink 1 gram of salt early in the morning
- fixate on getting 1 most difficult cognitive task and 1 most difficult physical task done in the morning
	- dopamine release from goal setting and accomplishing
- regular, predictable, tractable practices first thing in the day
	- making your bed etc.
	- it's about being in control of yourself and your process
	- improves goal-directed behavior

#### Cold treatment
- morning cold shower
	- thermogenesis, brown fat
	- dopamine
	- resilience
- best to do in the morning, will push the body more towards alertness

#### Supplements, Caffeine
- herbal supplements for testosterone production
	- tonga ali 400mg, fedogia aggrestus 600mg
- caffeine, drink 2 hours after waking up

#### Exercise
- do at least 15 min light exercise in the morning to get norepinephrine primed
- deep work, 90min is the best 
	- avoid multi-tasking

#### Idling
- Idling: let your brain idle, still avoid multi-tasking

#### Intermittent fasting
- Intermittent fasting, eat for the first time after your first focus session (~10:30 to noon)
	- when blood glucose low, unable to focus
	- when you have high blood glucose -> sleepy
	- -> want to fast, but not so long that you can't concentrate
	- stick to a moderate first meal though so you don't overeat

#### Body position
- maintain good posture either sitting or standing
- avoid sitting all day
- do another deep work session

#### Goal Setting
	- lay out concrete steps
	- visualize failure

## Phase 2

- do things that require less energy and focus later in the day
- Incorporate Play into the second phase of your day

#### Heat treatment
- best to do later in the day
- will push the body more towards sleep

#### Sleep
- get as much sleep as you need
	- keep area cold, dark
	- warm shower before bed
	- avoid screens
