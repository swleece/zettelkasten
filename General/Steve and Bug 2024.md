# Steve and Bug 2024

for Mom

In 2024, we moved down to Los Angeles after staying with family over the holidays as Bug started her new job at Belkin.
Our AirBnb life continued for a couple months before we found a more long term place to stay at near the Hollywood sign and Beechwood canyon.
We signed our first lease together and acquired lots of furniture to fill the quaint spot and we've grown to love it.
Bruno found a new daycare within walking distance to got to occasionally, while Steve has frequented the climbing gym nearby and Bug attends mat pilates and yoga classes.

Bug was heads down with her new job early on, but has found her footing and worked out her schedule which involves regular meetings with coworkers in China (no work trips over there yet, but that may happen in 2025!). 
Steve continued work at AppFolio remotely.

Travellings:
- Texas to see friends and view the eclipse ðŸŒ™
- Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, Fuji) to appreciate the culture and country ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µðŸ—»

Steve scaled back (no pun intended) on the outdoor climbing trips this year, but did climb his first 14'ers, Mt. Whitney and Mt. Russell, on a long weekend fall trip.
Bug made a beautiful home and continues to be the best dog mother.

Finally, the big update, Bug and Steve are engaged and planning their wedding next summer in Goleta!!
