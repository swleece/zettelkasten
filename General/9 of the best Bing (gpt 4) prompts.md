1. You will ask me interview questions for the position detailed on this page. I am a candidate for this job. I want you to only reply as the interviewer. Do not write all the conversation at once. Ask me the questions and wait for my answers. Do not write explanations. Ask me the questions one by one and wait for my answers.
2. (Ask bing to improve its responses) 
3. I want you to act as my time travel guide.I will provide you with the historical period or future time I want to visit and you will suggest the best events, sights, or people to experience, as if we were living in those times. Do not write explanations, simply provide interesting suggestions and stay in character. My first request is "I want to visit the Viking period in Britain."
