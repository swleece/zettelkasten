- ideas for website blurb:

potentially pull out bug quotes
Anecdote:
A young Driskel family sent out a Christmas card in which Patty and Dana describe their young daughters with shocking accuracy, especially with respect to then 2 year old Bug.
"Jean is the artist, the theatrical one, the animal lover. Julianna is the terrorist, the technician, the athlete. Jean is a blond, blue eyed California Girl stereotype. Julianna is a red head with the stereotypical temper, but a great sense of humor to balance it."
I can't read this without smiling at the thought of a wild toddler Bug.
The quote inspires a couple memories for me:
- Early in our relationship, when I had only met Patty and Dana a handful of times, she abruptly pulled over, grabbed a rentable electric scooter off the sidewalk and threw it into her car. It was a novelty she wanted to drive up the hill to show to her parents.
- Running trails in Joshua Tree National Park after work when we planned to run a marathon. We haven't yet run marathon but enjoying the sunsets together on those runs remains a wonderful memory.

As a partner in life, I've grown to appreciate Julianna's depth of character.
She dedicates herself to building strong relationships and is loyal and supportive of those she loves. 
She is also a singular thinker with a strong imagination and a unique view of the world. We often tell each other about our dreams in the morning, and I can tell you that her brain explores far more fantastical places than mine.

In the fullness of time, I think we'll find that early read of Bug to be as true at 2 as it is at 92.
