# 2024 Taxes

Invalid roth ira contributions in 2023 and 2024. In 2023 I contributed too much to Roth IRA by a small amount. In 2024, before doing my taxes and realizing I had contributed too much in 2023, I again contributed too much (the full amount ($7000). Then I did my taxes for 2023 and realized my 2024 contribution was invalid.

- contributed $7000 to my Roth IRA despite having a Modified Adjusted Gross Income that does not allow this
	- so I did a IRA excess contribution removal on Vanguard
	- wip
- I *think* I may have done the same thing for 2023, but am not sure
	- if so, I may need to pay capital gains on the short term gains on the money that I had to do an excess removal on for 2023
	- when filing for 2025, I may need to do the same thing again for short term gains made from the money that was in my account starting in 2024

- 
- fill out 8606 form irs to declare the excess contribution removal, will get a vanguard 1099 in 2025 that I can report as well, excess contribution removal are reported in the calendar year they are submitted
- $1360.32 , earned amount on $7000 contribution
- 12712
