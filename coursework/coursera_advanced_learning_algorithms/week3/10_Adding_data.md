## Title
How to add data to improve performance

## Description
Data augmentation: (modify existing examples to get more)

Example: 
OCR: image of letter A
- reverse it, rotate it, enlarge, etc. to make many training examples out of one
- introduce distortions 

Speech recognition:
- add different kinds of noisy background to original audio

Changes should be representative of possible data (not usually helpful if 
adding purely random noise)

Data synthesis: (create new examples)
(mostly used in OCR)

Example: 
screenshot letters from different fonts 

## Additional Notes
Much focus has been placed on developing models.
It often makes sense to focus on getting good data.
