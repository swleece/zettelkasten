## Title
Possible steps to debug learning algorithm

## Description
Get more training examples            -> fixes high variance
Try smaller sets of features          -> fixes high variance
Try getting additional features       -> fixes high bias
Try adding polynomial features        -> fixes high bias
Try decreasing lambda                 -> fixes high bias
Try increasing lambda                 -> fixes high variance

High bias -> model not doing well even on training set
High variance -> model overfitting, doing too well on training set
