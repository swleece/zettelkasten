## Title
Stochastic environment: models randomness in the environment

## Description
interested in maximizing the **Average** value of the sum of discounted rewards


$$Return = Average(R_1 + \gamma R_2 + \gamma R_3 + ... )$$


## Additional Notes
Modified Bellman equation:
$$Return = R_1 + \gamma E[max\_a' Q(s',a'))$$
