## Title
Epsilon greedy policy

## Description
Prioritizes exploration of the action space. (as opposed to exploitation)

Instead of always picking a to try to maximize Q(s,a), choose to sometimes pick an action a randomly.

exploitation vs exploration tradeoff

## Additional Notes

One common strategy is to start off with epsilon high, then gradually decrease it

e.g. 1.0 --> 0.01 gradually
