## Title
Reinforcement Learning overview

## Description
Reward function incentivizes better behavior from the model.  

Goal: 
Choose a policy $$\pi (s) = a$$ that will tell us what action (a) to take in state s so as to maximize the expected return.

Often these algorithms can be more finicky around tuning parameters.

## Additional Notes

Autonomous helicopter example:
- +1 from reward fx for every second spent in good state
- high negative reward when flying in poor state or crashing

Other examples:
- controlling robots
- factory optimization
- financial trading
- playing games (incl. video games)


- It is much easier to get reinforcement algos to work in simulation than in real applications.
- There are far fewer RL applications than supervised and unsupervised approaches.
